## What is Conditional Rendering?

Conditional rendering is the process of rendering different components or elements based on certain conditions. In React, you can use different techniques to achieve conditional rendering, including if-else statements, ternary operators, switch statements, and logical operators.

## Ternary Operators

The ternary operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement. When condition evaluates to true, the operator returns “First Component”; otherwise (when condition is false) it returns “Second Component”.

We use Ternary Operators for rendering different components or elements based on certain conditions.

## Why Conditional Rendering is Necessary in React Applications

There are several reasons why you might want to use conditional rendering in your React applications:

Improved User Experience: Conditional rendering allows you to create dynamic user interfaces that adapt to changes in data and user interactions.

By showing and hiding content based on the user's actions or the application state, you can create a more intuitive and engaging user experience.

Improved Performance: By conditionally rendering content, you can avoid rendering unnecessary components and improve the performance of your application.

This is particularly important in larger applications where unnecessary rendering can lead to performance issues.
Simplified Code: Conditional rendering can help you simplify your code and make it more readable.
By using conditional statements to decide what content should be rendered, you can avoid duplicating code and create more modular components.

Flexibility: Conditional rendering allows you to create more flexible and customizable components. By rendering different content based on the application state, you can create components that can be used in different contexts and adapt to different user interactions.
