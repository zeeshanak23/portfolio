## Benefits of having a Portfolio Website

it provides a platform to showcase your relevant skills and experience

it shows your personality

it lets hiring managers find you instead of you reaching out to them

you are easily searchable on search engines like Google

# What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a popular front-end CSS framework which is used to develop responsive and mobile friendly websites. The latest release of Bootstrap is version 5.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure consists of index.html, style.css, and script.js files and an images folder. We'll write all CSS in the style.css file and the JavaScript in the script.js file .

In the index.html file, you can see the HTML boilerplate code with the Bootstrap CDN, font awesome kit, and a link to the external style sheet and JavaScript.

## How to Add a Navigation Menu to Your Portfolio

Now, let's work on adding a navigation menu in our project. It will help visitors find the relevant info they're looking for.

We will use Bootstrap's fixed-top class in nav element to keep the navbar at the top of the page. The navbar also has a navbar-brand class where we keep the name of the person as a brand.

## The navbar has the following features:

It has six links: home, about, services, portfolio, contact, and footer

It has a transparent background. We will add a dark background on page scrolling later.

It toggles on smaller devices

## How to Add a Hero Header to the Portfolio

Now, we will be adding a hero image with some text in the center. A hero image is a web design term which refers to a high quality full width image that displays the company or individual's main goals, a representative image, photo, or other eye-catching elements. It helps attract users to your site.

## Conclusion

This is how you can create a complete responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5 .

In this blog post we saw some of the benefits of creating a portfolio website for web developers and designers. We divided the whole website into different sections and discussed each one individually as we built it.

You can customize this website based on your own use cases.

I hope you found this post useful.

Happy Coding!
